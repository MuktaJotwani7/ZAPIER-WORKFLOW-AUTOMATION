This project demonstrates a Zapier Workflow Automation that streamlines business processes by integrating Google Sheets, Slack, and Zoho CRM. Whenever a new entry is added to Google Sheets, Zapier triggers an automated Slack notification and simultaneously updates records in Zoho CRM.
Zapier Workflow Automation
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I automated a business workflow using Zapier by connecting Google Sheets, Slack, and Zoho CRM. The automation helps reduce manual work, keeps communication real-time, and ensures data consistency.

⚡ Workflow Steps

Trigger – Whenever a new or updated row is added in Google Sheets, Zapier detects the change.

Action 1 – A Slack message is automatically sent to a specific channel, notifying the team about the new/updated entry.

Action 2 – The same entry is pushed into Zoho CRM (or Zoho Books) to keep customer/lead records up to date.

🛠 Tools Used

Zapier (for automation)

Google Sheets (data source)

Slack (team communication)

Zoho CRM / Zoho Books (customer data management)

🚀 Key Benefits

Saves time by eliminating manual data entry.

Keeps teams updated instantly via Slack.

Ensures accurate and real-time synchronization with CRM.
